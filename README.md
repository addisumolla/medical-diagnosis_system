# Medical-Diagnosis_System(Expert System)
This Medical Diagnosis System is an expert system designed to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing medical conditions based on patient symptoms. Built using Prolog, the system leverages rule-based reasoning to evaluate symptoms and provide potential diagnoses.

## Features
* **Symptom Evaluation**: Users can input patient symptoms, and the system will analyze them against a database of medical knowledge.
* **Expert Knowledge Base**: The system contains a comprehensive set of rules and facts about various medical conditions, allowing for accurate diagnosis.
* **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to be intuitive, this system makes it easy for users to navigate and input data.
* **Inference Engine**: Utilizes Prolog's powerful inference capabilities to deduce possible conditions based on the given symptoms.
* **Recommendations**: Provides suggestions for further tests or specialist consultations based on the inferred conditions.

## Technologies Used:
* **Programming Language**: Prolog 
* **Knowledge Representation**: Rule-based logic for storing and processing medical information.

## Usage
To use the system, run the Prolog program and follow the prompts to input symptoms. The system will then provide potential diagnoses and recommendations.

## Future Enhancements:
* Expand the knowledge base with more medical conditions and symptoms.
  
* Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for improved user interaction.
  
* Integrate with medical databases for up-to-date information.
